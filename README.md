# VBA_Challenge


## Purpose
In this Project, a set of data from stock market was analyzed in order to loop all data to collect a comprehensive data set, then we will determine if the recusnstruction of the VBA codes has resulted the scriprt run faster or not. Ultimately we want to make the codes more usabale with taking less steps along with using less memory to make a smooth reading out of it for the readers.

### 	What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Advantages:
finding the main cause of a potential bug can be done using reconstruction. a programmer could, under repetative manners, unnessesary loops, find additional statements with codes that were run to implement the errors. It can also imact another programmers vision while reading it.
Dissadvantages:
programing can have different approaches towards a resolution of a problem. Whithin these differences, programmers may have logical alternatives approaches which need to be tested. breaking a stable code  to implement a different set can be costly or cause new problems in the system.   



#### Results

with comparisson of 2017 and 2018, the difference in daily volume of between the 2 years led an increase the volume that was less than $100k, was not sufficient for the 2018's positive outcome
Because of positive outcome of 2018, it looks to bea promoissing investment and both tickers RUN and ENPH are more than $200k which is increased compare to 2017


#####	How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script
Reducing the number of loops, reduces the required memory for analyzing the data and as a result reduces the time. in order to midify the code, there has to be atesting after every addition
